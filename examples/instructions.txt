DESCRIPTION:

Not always does a webdeveloper have a free hand at what he should do. Actually most of the time he is at his client's and a graphic designer's mercy.

A frontend developer is given an image and is expected to deliver HTML & CSS code within a short time.

He can't choose to do something differently or in an easier way only because he feels like it. The client wants this exact design and thats it.

This challenge will make you try just that - take an image that the client made together with a graphic designer and recreate it in code.

The task
Download this file: challenge.zip and unpack it.

The file contains an image of the entire page's design, a document containing all the texts used on the page and a folder with separate images that you will need.

The task is to recreate the designed image in working HTML & CSS.

Notes
The keyword here is pixel perfection. The client wants exactly this. Try to get as close to the original image as possible.

The fonts used in the design are Alegreya and Open Sans. Both can be found on Google fonts.

For measuring and color sampling a developer would generally use a graphical program (eg. Photoshop), but you can do just as well with a couple of Chrome plugins.

Just open the image with the design in Chrome (make sure you have it zoomed at 100% size) and use these plugins (or find some others for youself):

For measurements: ruler plugin

For color picking: Colorzilla or ColorPick Eyedropper

Because you might have problems using the Chrome plugins on local files here's another way to look at the design: design.html

The designer did not design a mobile-phone version of the page. Do it yourself!

Add CSS media queries to make the page look nice on mobile phones and other small screen devices.
